# s2cellid-node

One day i need to play with S2 Geometry in Node, i found node-s2, unfortunately that library is outdated only support node v0.10.0 so i am trying to make the  addon to be work again.

Bindings for the [S2 Geometry Library](https://code.google.com/p/s2-geometry-library/) into
[node.js](http://nodejs.org/).

For usage information, see the examples in the `examples/` directory.
